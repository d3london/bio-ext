{"id":55,"text":"BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing revealed a pathogenic variant in the BRCA2 gene (c.5946delT, p.Ser1982Argfs*22). This mutation is associated with an increased lifetime risk of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. No pathogenic variants were detected in the BRCA1 gene. The patient should be referred to a genetic counselor to discuss the implications of this result, including enhanced cancer surveillance protocols, risk-reducing surgical options, and potential targeted therapies if cancer develops. Cascade genetic testing is recommended for blood relatives. It's crucial to emphasize that this result indicates an increased cancer risk but does not guarantee cancer development. Management should be tailored to the patient's personal and family history, age, and other risk factors.","source_id":"FSs-4JQBCkLMeT6txole","label":["BRCA2 positive"],"Comments":[]}
{"id":56,"text":"Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 resulted in no pathogenic variants being found. This outcome indicates a lower likelihood of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

{"id":61,"text":"Analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes showed no pathogenic variants. However, a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) was detected in the BRCA2 gene (c.5744C>T, p.Thr1915Met). The clinical significance of this variant is currently unknown. Management decisions should not be based solely on this finding. The patient should be referred to a genetic counseling to discuss the implications, including the possibility of variant reclassification in the future. Cancer risk assessment and management should be based on personal and family history. Regular breast cancer screening is advised based on standard guidelines.
